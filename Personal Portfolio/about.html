<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am currently putting in extra effort these days to win myself a scholarship by performing well in all my studies and other certifications as an international student. I believe expanding qualifications will turn over new leaves and prepare me for academic and professional challenges in the future. Two of the largest interests of mine are design and programming—the two categories that fascinate me since they allow me to combine technical know-how with innovative thinking. Creative and logical problem-solving is something that I am extremely content with.</p>

<p>My background has driven my determination and attitude. I was once not taking good care of myself and got body-shamed by everyone daily. It was a hard experience, driving me in an endless cycle of torture, but it drew me into a new mindset. Rather than letting it harm me, I chose to take charge of it, not only to deal with things harshly, not to go through it, but also to determine my attitude. In doing so, I was creating self-value and having the discipline to contribute to the journey ahead.</p>
Now, I aim to consume more knowledge, not as a student, but as a person who has a goal. I want to push myself, trying to create something worthy of my time, and become a person who has the solution for all the problems. I am well aware that the path will be challenging, yet I’m giving it my all and staying focused on what's ahead of me.
